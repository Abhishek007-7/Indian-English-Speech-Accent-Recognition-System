# Indian English Speech Accent Recognition System

This repository contains the implementation of an Indian English Speech Accent Recognition System, which uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify accents based on regional variations in spoken English across India.

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to enhance the adaptability and inclusivity of speech recognition systems by accurately identifying regional accents in Indian English. This system can be integrated into Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tools to improve performance and usability for users with diverse linguistic backgrounds.

**Highlights:**
- Developed a regional accent detection system using the Indic TTS dataset with MFCC features.
- Leveraged models like **SVM**, **Random Forest**, **CNN**, and **LSTM**.
- Achieved robust performance across **16 Indian accents** using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, optimizing metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.

## 📂 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the **Indic TTS** database, developed by IIT Madras. It is a comprehensive dataset designed to support speech-related research, including:

- High-quality audio samples recorded by **male and female speakers**.
- Representation of accents from the following Indian languages:

| Language | Accent |
|----------|--------|
| Bengali  | ✅ Male, ✅ Female |
| Gujarati | ✅ Male, ✅ Female |
| Kannada  | ✅ Male, ✅ Female |
| Malayalam| ✅ Male, ✅ Female |
| Marathi  | ✅ Male, ✅ Female |
| Rajasthani| ✅ Male, ✅ Female |
| Telugu   | ✅ Male, ✅ Female |

The dataset can be downloaded from the [Indic TTS website](https://www.iitm.ac.in/donlab/indictts/database).

### 🔍 **Data Composition**
- **Number of Speakers**: Both male and female speakers are equally represented.
- **Audio Quality**:
  - Uniform length of **10 seconds** per clip.
  - Sampling rate resampled to **16 kHz**.
- **Data Split**:
  - **Training**: 70%
  - **Testing**: 20%
  - **Validation**: 10%

| **Accent**   | **Female Count** | **Male Count** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Bengali      | 4,197            | 5,316          |
| Gujarati     | 4,670            | 4,824          |
| Kannada      | 5,406            | 5,825          |
| Malayalam    | 5,132            | 5,131          |
| Marathi      | 5,059            | 5,578          |
| Rajasthani   | 4,933            | 5,946          |
| Telugu       | 2,969            | 3,183          |

## 🛠️ **Features**

The system uses the following features extracted from audio:
- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**: Capture phonetic details.
- **Chroma Features**: Represent harmonic content.
- **Spectral Contrast**: Highlight energy variations across frequencies.

---

## 🤖 **Models**

The following machine learning and deep learning models were used:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Decision Trees**
- **CNN-LSTM**

### 🏆 **Best Performing Model**
- **XGBoost** achieved the highest accuracy of **99.02%**, followed by **CNN-LSTM** with **98.70%**.

---

## 🧩 **Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Noise reduction, normalization, and signal conditioning.
   - Standardization of audio to uniform duration and sampling rate.
   - Data augmentation (e.g., pitch shifting, speed variation, noise addition).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracted MFCC, Chroma, and Spectral Contrast features using the Librosa library.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Models were trained using stratified K-fold cross-validation.
   - Evaluated on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Interface**:
   - A user-friendly GUI developed with Tkinter allows real-time predictions by uploading audio files.
